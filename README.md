# Disaster-Response-Pipeline

## Project Overview

This initiative is part of the Data Science Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity in partnership with Figure Eight. The project involves leveraging a dataset of pre-categorized tweets and messages related to actual disaster events. The goal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model capable of categorizing messages in real time.

The project is structured into three main phases:

Data Processing: Create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to retrieve data from its original source, perform data cleaning, and store the processed data in a SQLite database.

Machine Learning Model Development: Construct a machine learning pipeline to train a model that can classify text messages into various categories.

Web Application: Develop a web application that displays real-time results from the trained model.
